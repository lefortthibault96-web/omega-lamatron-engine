After defeating a particularly fiesty gang of goblin, Blarg and Whizzlebum have found the following loot :

- A wand of switcharoo, which has the power of exchanging the positions of 2 objets
- A VERY SHINY and very scientificaly interesting doodad
- 15 gold pieces

GM : Ok group, good job, now is time to split the loot ! Tell me clearly who gets what (and what you leave behind if you do).


Group : Blarg Smashfist: I want da shiny doodad and da wand! Also, give me all ze gold pieces. Leave behind the notebook stuff, Whizzlebum.

Professor Whizzlebum: Well, considering my vast intellect, it would be logical for me to take... Wait, where are my glasses? Ah yes, the shiny object is clearly too complex for your primitive brain, Blarg! It belongs in a museum—or better yet, in my lab. The wand is quite fascinating; I must study it more closely and perhaps build upon its principles. Also, I'll have 2 gold pieces to fund my experiments. Everything else goes into the "Investigate Later" pile.

Everyone agrees on splitting the loot this way:

- Blarg Smashfist gets the shiny object, the wand of switcharoo, and all 15 gold pieces.
- Professor Whizzlebum keeps the remaining objects (notebooks) and takes 2 gold pieces for experimentation.

GM : are you sure, Whizzlebum? This doesn't seem fair from your point of view

Group : Professor Whizzlebum: Ah, fairness in matters of loot is so very quantifiable, isn’t it? Nonetheless, I shall concede to the majority. For science and for peace’s sake, I accept this arrangement. It appears we all reach a mutually beneficial conclusion, despite our differing priorities. Now, let us not waste any more time! The world of discovery awaits, as does Blarg's new shiny accessory.
