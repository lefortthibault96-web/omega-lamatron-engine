# Description

Today, our intrepid group of 4 is doing a classic dungeon crawl, they've done their business as usual, kill the mobs, kill the boss, get the loot. But, after the Boss Room, where they would expect to find a nicely game-designed loop to the entrance of the dungeon for easy exit, they instead find themselves in front of a door blocking the way.
It's a massive granite door, with a massive granite head sculpted into it. With its flat, massive granite voice, it bellows "PLEASE RECOCUMBULATE."
But you don't know what recocumbulate even means...
# Turn 1
## Summary
Dicepaw Critclaw: The imperious cat dismisses the door's command as a typo, attempting to correct it for no avail.

Goblinette: She dramatically insists that "recocumbulate" means reclining or sitting down before proceeding with the door, setting an example by elegantly taking a seat.

Professor Whizzlebum: The bespectacled scholar analyzes the Latin root 'cumba' and agrees with Goblinette's interpretation, suggesting a short rest would be prudent.

Blarg Smashfist: Confused and impatient, the brutish goblin misinterprets "recocumbulate" as sitting on laps and readies for physical action if needed.

## Full Turn

GM : The massive granite doors asks you to recocumbulate, none of know know what this means. Designate among youselves the one who will act or say something first

Dicepaw Critclaw: *rolls tiny dice* Well, obviously it's a typo. The door meant 'recapitulate.' I'll clarify that for them. *struts forward, looking at the door imperiously*

Goblinette: Oh my goodness, no! It clearly says recocumbulate and that means we must recline or sit down before proceeding! How ever could you be so rude as to ignore a command from such an impressive door? *bats eyelashes dramatically*

Professor Whizzlebum: Ah yes, the erudite among us will note the Latin root 'cumba' meaning to recline. Thus, recocumbulate is indeed akin to recapitulate but referring specifically to physical rest! *proudly taps goggles* I suggest we take a short respite, my friends.

Blarg Smashfist: *scratches head, looking at the door confused* Uhh... what it say? Recocumbu... lap? Like sit on laps? But why? Is this a new type of puzzle? *thumps chest with fist* I ready to smash if that's what needed!

Dicepaw Critclaw: *scoffs* It's not a lap, you oaf. Pay attention! We're to recline or take a seat before the door opens. Clearly it's some sort of ritual or test. *turns back to the group* Everyone sit down on the floor right here in front of the door. That should satisfy it.

Goblinette: Oh dear, I do hope that will suffice! One wouldn't want to anger such a grand and powerful portal. *flicks skirt and sits elegantly, crossing legs*

Professor Whizzlebum: Indeed, best not to provoke it further. Perhaps a moment's rest before proceeding is warranted in any case. *settles cross-legged with a sigh, adjusting his lab coat*

Blarg Smashfist: *hesitates, then plops down heavily, nearly knocking Goblinette over* There! Me sit now! Door open yet?

GM : You all sit before the massive door, taking the opportunity to rest. It's refreshing but after a few minutes, the door still hasn't moved.
# Turn 2
## Summary
Blarg Smashfist takes a step back, singed from the door's lightning bolt strike after futilely attempting to smash it open.

## Full Turn

GM : Dicepaw, what do you do?

Dicepaw Critclaw : *rolls tiny dice again and mutters under his breath* Stupid door, not moving... Must be more than just sitting down. *stands up and approaches the granite face* Alright, let's see if we can provoke it into action with some more... assertive language. "Door! We have complied with your bizarre request. Now open, you unresponsive hunk of rock!"

GM : After a few second, the door bellows "PLEASE RECOCUMBULATE!"

Dicepaw Critclaw : *takes a step back and crosses arms imperiously* Fine, we'll sit. But don't think for a moment I'm doing this out of any actual respect for you or your door decrees. *plops down on the floor again with an exaggerated sigh* There, happy now? Open up already!

GM : The door doesn't react.

GM : Goblinette, it's your turn


Goblinette : "Oh dearie me! If sitting isn't enough, I suppose we must recline properly, like in a royal goblin throne room!" *She stretches out on the floor with a dramatic flourish, back arched and legs splayed out to either side.* "There, is that more to your liking, great door?"

GM : The door doesn't react.


Goblinette : *Goblinette sits up, dusting off her skirts and adjusting her tiara.* "This is simply ridiculous! If mere sitting and reclining won't suffice, perhaps we must... entertain the door with some royal goblin hospitality first!" *She stands and curtsies deeply, then begins to sing in a sweet, clear voice:*
"Oh mighty door of stone so grand,
How may we please thy granite hand?
With music, dance, or feast? Pray tell,
That we might pass this portal's spell."

*She finishes with a dramatic flourish, expecting the door to respond positively.*

GM : After a few second, the door bellows "PLEASE RECOCUMBULATE!"

GM : Whizzlebum, your turn.


Professor Whizzlebum : *Professor Whizzlebum frowns thoughtfully, stroking his chin.* "Hmm, it seems our performances of sitting and reclining have fallen flat. Let us try an alternative approach, based on the door's grammatical structure." *He consults one of his many notebooks.* "Ah yes, I believe 'recocumbulate' is the gerund form of the verb 'to recumbulate.' Thus, it implies a process or action rather than a simple state. Very well then..." *He clears his throat and begins to speak in an exaggerated, singsong voice.*

"Oh mighty door, please do recocumbulate with us!
Let us recline as one in perfect harmony.
Stretch out and rest upon the dungeon floor,
Side by side, in sweet companionship once more!"

*The professor finishes with a flourish of his hands and a hopeful grin.*

GM : The door doesn't react.


Professor Whizzlebum : *sighs, removing goggles* Ah well, it seems my attempt at poetic persuasion also fell on deaf granite ears. I suppose we must try a different tack... *he rummages in his coat pockets, producing a small silver pocket watch* Perhaps a demonstration of time itself can stir the door to action? *Professor Whizzlebum flips open the watch and begins winding it rapidly with both hands.*

GM : Describe what you intend by doing this


Professor Whizzlebum : *Professor Whizzlebum intends to demonstrate the concept of time and motion by rapidly winding his pocket watch, hopefully providing a visual cue for the granite door's next action.*

GM : The door doesn't react.

GM : Blarg, your turn


Blarg Smashfist : *Grumbles and stands up* Uhh... if sit down, recline, sing, and wind watch not work... then ME SMASH! *Starts charging at the door with a loud roar*

GM : With all your might, you smash the door with your great axe. Your powerful blow glances harmfuly off the very solid rock door. You haven't even made a scratch.

GM : After a few second, the door bellows "PLEASE RECOCUMBULATE!", then zaps you with a lightning bolt.


Blarg Smashfist : *Blarg yelps in pain and surprise as the lightning bolt strikes him, his muscles seizing up from the jolt. He stumbles backwards, dropping _Thunk_ and clutching at his singed fur.* Oww! Door hurt Blarg! *He looks at the door with a mix of anger and confusion.* Why door no like Blarg smash? Blarg just want open so they can leave dungeon already!
# Turn 3
## Summary
Dicepaw Critclaw: Dicepaw remains skeptical, still sprawled on the floor with a bemused expression as their synchronized napping attempt fails.

Goblinette: The goblinette looks crestfallen as she realizes the door didn't budge after their harmonious reclining, her hands falling limply to her sides.

Blarg Smashfist: Blarg blinks in confusion, still rubbing at his singed fur as he tries to process why the synchronized nap didn't work despite everyone's best efforts.

Professor Whizzlebum: Professor Whizzlebum's face falls, disappointment etched across his features as he realizes his deciphering of "recocumbulate" led them down a dead-end path.

## Full Turn

GM : Dicepaw, it's your turn


Dicepaw Critclaw : *Dicepaw rolls his eyes and saunters over to Blarg, batting at the singed fur with a paw.* Oh please, you nearly got yourself electrocuted. What did you expect? The door was just defending itself from your amateur attempts at destruction.

*He turns back to the unyielding granite face.* Clearly, violence won't work here. We need to think... or rather, let Professor Whizzlebum think for us. Perhaps he can decipher some cryptic clue hidden in that strange command. *Dicepaw crosses his arms and looks expectantly at the professor.*

Professor Whizzlebum : *Professor Whizzlebum blinks, then nods thoughtfully.* Ah yes, an intriguing puzzle indeed! I propose we examine the etymology of "recocumbulate" further. Clearly it's related to reclining or resting, but the repetition suggests a more complex meaning... *He begins scribbling notes in his pocketbook, muttering to himself.* Perhaps it indicates a need for synchronicity or unity in our reclining? An act of communal rest before proceeding? *Looks up expectantly at the group.*

GM : what does the group respond to Whizzlebum

Dicepaw Critclaw: "Pfft, synchronized napping? That's rich coming from you, Professor." He snickers under his breath but doesn't dismiss the idea outright.

Goblinette: "Ooh, a communal rest sounds lovely! We could all recline together in perfect harmony, just like the good professor suggested!" She claps her hands gleefully. 

Blarg Smashfist: *blinks slowly, still rubbing at his singed fur* Synchronized nap... means everyone sit down together at same time? Like, a group effort? Blarg try understand...

Professor Whizzlebum: "Exactly so, my dear friends! A unified act of reclining would seemingly satisfy the door's request. Let us proceed forthwith and attempt this synchronized recocumbulation!" He stands up straight, puffing out his chest in enthusiasm for the new plan.

GM : It doesn't work, you all recline in perfect harmony, but the door doesn't move.
# Turn 4
## Summary
Blarg Smashfist enthusiastically leads his companions in crawling on all fours, trying to appease the mysterious door's command to "recocumbulate" like beasts.

Goblinette adopts a predatory panther-like stance as she crawls forward with wicked glee, relishing this uncivilized exercise in mimicry.

Dicepaw Critclaw begrudgingly follows suit, grumbling about blaming Blarg and Professor Whizzlebum for any future mishaps if crawling doesn't work.

Professor Whizzlebum moves on all fours with scholarly curiosity, observing the door's unchanging surface as he participates in their bestial posturing test.

## Full Turn

GM : Dicepaw, your turn


Dicepaw Critclaw : *stares at the unyielding door in exasperation* Well, that was a waste of time. Synchronized napping clearly isn't the solution here. *rolls tiny dice and mutters under his breath* Maybe if we actually had something to nap on... *eyes the granite floor with disdain before looking back up at the group* We need a new approach. Anyone else have any brilliant ideas?

GM : Does any of you have a new idea?


Group : Blarg Smashfist: Blarg think... Blarg remember something! Door say "recocumbulate" but not just sit down. Door want us to get on floor, like... like animals! Yes! Blarg has it! We all crawl around on ground like big furry beasts! That must be what door mean!

*Blarg starts to crouch down, preparing to plop onto the dungeon floor and begin crawling about like an animal.*

GM : How does the rest of the group react?


Blarg Smashfist : *The others stare at Blarg in disbelief, then at each other.* Goblinette: "Crawl around like beasts? Oh my, that's... unconventional." Dicepaw: "You can't be serious, Blarg. We're not a pack of wolves or something."

*Professor Whizzlebum, however, looks intrigued and starts scribbling more notes in his pocketbook.*

GM : What's your next move?


Professor Whizzlebum : An intriguing hypothesis from Blarg! I believe he may be onto something. *strokes chin thoughtfully* If we interpret "recocumbulate" as imitating an animal's behavior, then a communal crawling or low-crawling posture could satisfy the door's demand.

I propose we test this theory by assuming various beastly postures on the ground. Let us begin with quadrupedal locomotion, akin to a canine or feline, and see if that elicits a response from our granite companion. *starts crouching down and extending arms for balance, preparing to plop onto all fours*

GM : Does the rest of the group follow Blarg and Whizzlebum?

Goblinette: *Goblinette's eyes light up with mischief.* Oh, an exercise in primal mimicry! How delightfully... uncivilized. *She grins wickedly and begins to crawl forward on all fours, mimicking a curious panther stalking its prey.* This should be most entertaining!

Dicepaw Critclaw: *sighs heavily* Fine, I suppose crawling is better than sitting or sleeping. But if this ends with us getting zapped again, I'm blaming Blarg and Professor Whizzlebum's harebrained ideas.

*He reluctantly joins the others in assuming a quadrupedal stance, grumbling under his breath as he awkwardly crawls forward.*

Blarg Smashfist: *Blarg grins widely, excited to test out his theory.* Yay! Crawl like beast now! Blarg lead the way! *He eagerly scuttles forward on all fours, furry belly scraping against the cold stone floor.*

Professor Whizzlebum: As the group begins their bestial crawling, I take a moment to observe our granite door. Its surface remains unyielding and impassive... for now.

*He then follows the others' example, moving on all fours with an air of scholarly curiosity.* Ah, the sensation is quite unique! One might almost forget oneself as a mere mortal in this primal state...

GM : That's still not it, maybe you should look for other clues than "reclining".
# Turn 5
## Summary
Goblinette assumes a rigid granite-like stance and solemnly intones an attempt to flatter the door into opening, but it only responds with disdain.

Dicepaw scoffs at Goblinette's idea, remaining on two legs as he brushes off any lingering dust from his crouched position. 

Blarg cautiously tests the hardness of the stone floor before mimicking its unyielding stance, unsure if this will appease the door.

Professor Whizzlebum studies his hand in admiration of its suppleness before adopting a stiffer posture to emulate the door's granite nature, awaiting the door's response with thinly veiled anticipation.

The Great Door of Granite remains unmoved by Goblinette's flattery, slamming shut and bellowing "FLATTERY DOES NOT WORK ON ME. PLEASE RECOCUMBULATE" in frustration at their continued failure to satisfy its demand.

## Full Turn

GM : Any ideas, Goblinette?


Goblinette : "Hmm... perhaps we're focusing too much on physical postures? I think 'recocumbulate' might imply a change in mindset or perspective rather than just bodily position." She pauses, tapping her chin thoughtfully before continuing: "What if we had to recast ourselves as something entirely different - like the door itself? We could try assuming identities befitting granite statues... silent, unyielding, and stoic. That might resonate with the door's stern demeanor."

GM : What's the rest of the group thinking about this idea?


Group : Dicepaw Critclaw: *rolls his eyes* Oh please, you want us to become inanimate objects now? What a ridiculous suggestion. We're not statues, we're adventurers.

*He shifts back onto two legs, brushing off any lingering dust.* If your harebrained idea doesn't work out, Goblinette, don't say I didn't warn you.

Blarg Smashfist: *Blarg looks confused as he crouches on the floor.* Become door? Like... be granite now? Blarg no understand. But maybe try...

*He tentatively reaches a hand up to touch the stone floor beneath him, as if testing its hardness before mirroring it.*

Professor Whizzlebum: Ah, an intriguing notion, Goblinette! Assuming the characteristics of our surroundings could indeed be a metaphorical approach to "recocumbulating." The door's granite composition provides a striking example.

*He takes a moment to study his own hand, flexing his fingers as if admiring their suppleness.* By mirroring the door's unyielding nature, we might demonstrate our willingness to adapt and become more... stolid. *Smiles thinly at Goblinette before standing up straight once more.* Shall we attempt this impersonation of granite?

Goblinette: "Well, it can't hurt to try. And who knows? Perhaps adopting a bit of the door's stoic demeanor will resonate with its granite soul."

*She takes a deep breath and steps forward, assuming a rigid posture reminiscent of a statue. Her voice becomes flat and measured as she addresses the door.*

"Great Door of Granite," she intones in a solemn tone, "we seek passage to the realms beyond. By adopting the steadfast nature of your stone, we offer ourselves as worthy travelers."

*The others watch with varying degrees of skepticism and anticipation to see if Goblinette's suggestion will finally satisfy the door's demand.*

GM : The door opens a little, then slams shut and bellows "FLATTERY DOES NOT WORK ON ME. PLEASE RECOCUMBULATE"
# Turn 6
## Summary
Dicepaw Critclaw proposed treating the unyielding door as an opponent in a battle of wits, suggesting taunts, challenges, or deals to try and persuade it to open.

## Full Turn

GM : Who wants to try something?


Group : Dicepaw Critclaw: *groans* This is getting ridiculous. We've tried sitting, sleeping, crawling like beasts, and even pretending to be statues. What's next, doing a tap dance on the floor? *he shakes his head in exasperation*

I have an idea, though it may sound crazy. What if we treat this door as an opponent in combat? Since it won't let us pass, maybe it's willing to engage in a battle of wits or... whatever granite doors can do.

*He looks at the others expectantly.* We could try taunting it, challenging its authority, or even offering it a deal - like letting it "win" this little standoff if it opens for us. It might just take the bait and let us through.

It's unorthodox, I know, but we're already dealing with a door that speaks in riddles and demands we act like animals. At this point, anything could work! *he grins wryly*

GM : Does the rest of the group agree with Dicepaw's idea?


Group : Dicepaw Critclaw: *The others consider Dicepaw's suggestion, looking at each other with a mix of curiosity and apprehension.* 

Blarg Smashfist: *Blarg scratches his head thoughtfully.* Deal with door? Blarg not sure... Door big and strong. We small.

*But then a mischievous glint appears in his eye.* Unless... we trick door into letting us through! Like, say something silly to make it laugh so hard it forgets about blocking our way!

*He grins widely, eager for a chance to playfully deceive the unyielding granite barrier.*

Goblinette: *Goblinette's eyes sparkle with amusement at Blarg's suggestion.* Oh, now that's an idea I can get behind! The door does seem rather stern and serious. A well-timed jest might just be the key to cracking its stoic facade.

*She turns to Dicepaw with a playful smirk.* What did you have in mind for this "battle of wits," Critclaw? Perhaps we could engage in some clever wordplay or riddles, showing the door that even granite has a soft side?

Professor Whizzlebum: *The bespectacled scholar nods thoughtfully as he ponders Dicepaw's proposal.* An unconventional approach, indeed, but one that might just exploit the door's rigid adherence to its own standards. By challenging those expectations through taunts or deals, we could potentially create a cognitive dissonance that prompts it to reconsider its stance.

*He smiles at the others.* I believe this plan warrants further exploration. Let us see if we can concoct an enticing offer or clever quip that will satisfy the door's requirements and grant us passage.

*The group begins brainstorming potential taunts, deals, riddles, and wordplay to use against the stubborn granite door, their creative juices flowing as they attempt to outsmart this inanimate opponent.*

GM : In the end, what potential taunts, deals, riddles, or wordplay does the group try on the door?


Group : After some collaborative brainstorming, the group comes up with a few creative approaches to engage with the granite door:

1. **Taunt:** Dicepaw suggests a playful jab at the door's prideful demeanor. "Well, well, look who thinks they're so tough! Granite walls can't hide the softie inside." He smirks, hoping to catch the door off guard and make it question its own rigidity.

2. **Deal:** Blarg proposes offering the door a 'challenge' of sorts. "Hey big G-door, let's play a game! If you open for us, we'll tell you three riddles and you try to answer them. If you get two right, we free you from this dungeon forever!"

3. **Riddle:** Goblinette crafts a clever puzzle that pokes fun at the door's literal nature. "What can be broken without hands, spoken without a mouth, burned without fire? Answer correctly, great door, and pass us through."

4. **Wordplay:** Professor Whizzlebum takes a stab at some puns, hoping to tickle the door's granite soul with humor. "Open sesame, open wide, let this motley crew inside! Or are you just a pretentious blockhead, unwilling to budge an inch?"

5. **Deal 2.0:** After some discussion, the group decides to combine elements of their previous ideas into a single 'challenge'. They propose a series of riddles and witty remarks to test the door's wit, with each successful answer bringing it closer to opening for them.

They deliver their challenge in an engaging, back-and-forth manner - presenting a riddle, followed by some humorous jabs or wordplay, and ending with an encouraging remark. This keeps the interaction dynamic and playful while still challenging the door intellectually.

The group's collaborative effort showcases their creativity, teamwork, and ability to think on their feet in this peculiar predicament. By employing clever wit and humor, they hope to persuade (or at least amuse) the stubborn granite door into granting them passage.
# Turn 7

GM : Ok, Diceclaw, you're first


Dicepaw Critclaw : *I saunter up to the door with an air of nonchalance, tail swishing behind me.* "Well, well, look who thinks they're so tough! Granite walls can't hide the softie inside. C'mon, door, let's see some real substance beneath that imposing facade." *I smirk at the door expectantly, waiting to gauge its reaction.*

GM : the door bellows "PLEASE RECOCUMBULATE!", then zaps you with a lightning bolt.


Dicepaw Critclaw : *I yelp and leap back from the electrifying strike, my fur standing on end.* "Ow! Okay, okay, no need to get so frickin' sparky!" *I rub at the singed patch of fur on my side before retreating a safe distance.* Clearly, this door doesn't appreciate my wit. Next!

GM : Goblinette, you're up !


Goblinette : *With a dramatic flourish of her cape, Goblinette steps forward and addresses the door in an elegant, singsong voice.* "Ah, great granite guardian, are you not tired of standing so sternly? Let us bring some levity to this stone corridor! Blarg's proposal of riddles is quite clever, don't you agree?" *She smiles coyly, awaiting the door's reaction to her attempt at charming persuasion.*

GM : the door bellows 'BEGONE, THOT!", then zaps you with a lightning bolt.


Goblinette : "Oh dear, it seems my charms have fallen flat! *she clasps her hands in mock despair* Well, on to the next plan, then!" *She steps back and glances at Blarg with a mischievous grin.* "Your turn, Smashy-pants. Let's see if your brand of humor fares any better."

GM : You're next


Blarg Smashfist : *Blarg stomps forward, a playful grin on his face.* "Hey big G-door, let's play! If you open for us, we'll give ya three riddles and if ya get two right, we free ya from this dungeon forever!" *He winks at the others, hoping his offer will tickle the door's fancy.*

GM : The door stays silent


Blarg Smashfist : *Blarg scratches his head in confusion, then grins.* "Hmm, maybe it's just not talkative before breakfast? Let me try again with a joke first!" *He takes a deep breath and booms out in a loud, goofy voice:* "Why did the door go to therapy? Because it had an 'opening up' issue! Get it? Opening... haha, I slay me!" *He chuckles, waiting for the door's reaction.*

GM : The door make a thunderous fake-laugh "HAHAHA, THAT'S AN INSULT TO MY PEOPLE YOU BIGGOT", then zaps you with a lightning bolt.


Blarg Smashfist : *Blarg yelps and leaps back, his fur standing on end from the electric shock.* "Ow! Geez, lighten up, door dude!" *He rubs at the singed patch of fur before retreating with a sheepish grin.* "Guess my joke skills need some work. Professor's turn now?"

GM : Your turn, Whizzlebum


Professor Whizzlebum : *Professor Whizzlebum approaches the door with a scholarly air, adjusting his spectacles.* "Ah, great granite gatekeeper, let us test your mettle through the realm of linguistics! I propose a riddle in verse, crafted to tease your thoughts and challenge your wit." *He clears his throat and begins reciting:*

"In solid form I first took shape,
From earth's depths forged by ancient heat.
I'm sculpted smooth, a stony face,
Yet inside, my true self can't escape."

*The professor pauses, waiting for the door's response to his poetic puzzle.*

GM : The door says "HEY! THAT'S ME!"


Professor Whizzlebum : "Ah, an astute observation by our granite friend!" *Professor Whizzlebum exclaims with delight.* "Indeed, the riddle does describe a statue like oneself, crafted from stone yet containing a consciousness within. Well done!"

*He bows slightly in respect to the door.* "I suppose I've unwittingly provided a clever confirmation of your existence and nature, haven't I? Perhaps we're making progress here through this exercise in self-reflection." *The professor looks at his companions with a thoughtful expression.* "Shall we continue our linguistic sparring match or attempt a different approach?"

GM : "OK MY TURN : I LOOK LIKE A NERD, I TALK LIKE A NERD, YET I'M AS STUPID AS A DIORITE PEBBLE"


Professor Whizzlebum : *Professor Whizzlebum chuckles good-naturedly at the door's playful jab.* "Ah, a clever retort! You've managed to poke fun at my scholarly demeanor while maintaining an air of wit yourself. I suppose that makes us even, granite gatekeeper - equally adept at linguistic jousting." *He smiles and nods in respect.* "Well played indeed!"

GM : the door bellows "PLEASE RECOCUMBULATE!", then zaps you with a lightning bolt.
# Turn 8

GM : The door begins charging up, you can feel the magical energies gathering inside of it, it's granite surface begins glowing. It says : "IF YOU FAIL TO RECOCUMBULATE WILLINGLY, I'LL RECOCUMBULATE YOU MYSELF!"

GM : Blarg, it's your turn


Blarg Smashfist : *Blarg looks at the glowing door, then at his friends.* "Hey, maybe we can all sit on each other? Goblinette on my head, Professor Whizzlebum in her lap, and Dicepaw Critclaw curled up behind them... That way everyone's touching and can recocumbulate together!" *He grins hopefully.*

GM : What does the group think about this idea?


Group : Goblinette: *Goblinette raises an eyebrow at Blarg's suggestion, a sly grin spreading across her face.* "Oh my, that's quite the creative solution you've proposed, Smashy-pants! While it might be a bit... cramped for comfort, I suppose it could work as a last resort to appease our granite friend." *She winks at him playfully.*

Professor Whizzlebum: *The bespectacled scholar considers Blarg's idea thoughtfully.* "While unconventional, this strategy does fulfill the door's demand for recocumbulation. It may even provide an opportunity for us to bond and work together as a team in our predicament." *He nods approvingly at Blarg.*

Dicepaw Critclaw: *Dicepaw rolls his eyes good-naturedly.* "Alright, alright, let's do it before the door turns us into granite statues. Just hope I don't get a crick in my neck from all this recocumbulating!" *He chuckles and begins positioning himself behind Goblinette as instructed.*

Blarg Smashfist: *Blarg beams with pride at his friends' enthusiasm for his idea.* "Woohoo! It's gonna work, guys! We're gonna recocumbulate our way past this stubborn door!" *He crouches down, offering a sturdy lap for Goblinette to perch upon as they prepare their synchronized sitting solution.*

*The group arranges themselves in the peculiar seating configuration, each member touching or resting on another as they attempt to fulfill the door's demand. They hold their breaths, awaiting the door's reaction to their unconventional compliance.*

GM : The door, still charging up its energies to unleash the ultimate recocumbulation upon your sorry asses, bellows indignantly "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU GUYS DOING?? DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT RECOCUMBULATE MEANS??"

Blarg Smashfist: *Blarg looks at the others sheepishly.* "Uh... I guess we kind of misinterpreted 'recocumbulate' as just sitting down and stuff..."

Dicepaw Critclaw: *Dicepaw scoffs.* "Yeah, who would've thought it meant something so literal? Like, you know, combining to form a new entity through the power of sitting."

Goblinette: *Goblinette giggles mischievously.* "Well, at least our attempt showed creativity, right? Though I'm not sure what 'recocumbulating' ourselves would even achieve, aside from an interesting new shape..."

Professor Whizzlebum: *The scholar's eyes widen as understanding dawns.* "Ah, I see now. The door's true intention was for us to combine into a single entity through our physical contact while recumbent. A form of unification or synergy, perhaps."

Blarg Smashfist: *Blarg looks at the others uncertainly.* "So... what do we do now? We can't really merge into one being just by sitting on each other..."

Dicepaw Critclaw: *Dicepaw shrugs.* "Well, unless you have a magic 'recocumbulate' spell up your sleeve, Blarg, I'm not sure how else to satisfy the door's demand. Maybe we can try explaining our misunderstanding and ask for clarification?"

Goblinette: *Goblinette grins slyly.* "Or perhaps we could propose an alternative form of unification that doesn't involve merging into a single lump of recumbent flesh... like, say, combining our skills and strengths to overcome the door's challenge together as a cohesive unit."

Professor Whizzlebum: *The professor nods in agreement.* "A collaborative approach could be quite effective. By pooling our knowledge, creativity, and problem-solving abilities, we may devise a solution that meets the door's criteria without resorting to literal physical merging."

Blarg Smashfist: *Blarg looks at his companions with newfound determination.* "Alright then! Let's work together, think outside the box, and show this stubborn door what teamwork can achieve!"

*The group begins brainstorming alternative methods of unification or synergy that would satisfy the door's demand without requiring them to merge into a single entity. They share their ideas, build upon each other's thoughts, and refine their strategy through collaborative problem-solving.*

It's too late, the door screams "I CAST : MASS RECOCUMBULATE!". You guys get recocumbulated HARD. It hurts a lot. You feel like you're being scrunched, mashed, torn apart and all manner of other painful verbs. Worse, it even seems to last for an eternity. You all loose consciouness. When you wake up, you find yourselves before the entrance of the dungeon like someone just tossed you loosers out with a granite kick in the ass. With fresh milk dripping from your mouths, you struggle to remember what happened to you. EVEN WORSE, you still don't know what "recocumbulate" means.



GM : Any closing words?


Group : *The group gathers themselves, still dazed and confused after their ordeal. They exchange bewildered glances, wondering how they managed to end up here with no recollection of the events that transpired.*

Dicepaw Critclaw: *He rubs his head, trying to clear the fog from his mind.* "Well, that was a wild ride... I think we can safely say 'recocumbulate' is a door-specific term. Let's just hope we never encounter it again."

Goblinette: *She licks her lips, savoring the taste of fresh milk.* "Mmm, at least we got some free snacks out of this mess. That's something, right?"

Blarg Smashfist: *He grins sheepishly as he looks down at himself and his companions.* "Hey, look on the bright side - we all fit together pretty snugly now! Maybe it was a bonding experience after all."

Professor Whizzlebum: *The scholar adjusts his spectacles, studying their unusual configuration with interest.* "Indeed. Our physical proximity may have unintended benefits in terms of teamwork and cooperation. It could prove advantageous in future challenges."

Dicepaw Critclaw: *He rolls his eyes.* "Yeah, because nothing says 'teamwork' like being squished into a single entity against your will."

Goblinette: *She chuckles mischievously.* "Well, at least we learned what not to do when the door tells us to recocumbulate. Next time, maybe we'll come prepared with a clever response of our own!"

Blarg Smashfist: *He nods enthusiastically.* "That's the spirit! We're a team, and together we can overcome any weird challenge that comes our way - even if it means sitting on each other in funny ways."

Professor Whizzlebum: *The professor smiles, placing a reassuring hand on Blarg's shoulder.* "Your optimism is admirable, young one. Indeed, through unity and cooperation, we shall face whatever trials the future may hold."
