GM: The hog is wriggling in a frenzy, trying to break free from your grip, what do you do about it?

Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist grins, his muscles straining against the determined pig. He tightens his arms around its middle and shakes the hog like a terrier with a chew toy. "Gotta show 'im who's boss!" he bellows at the squirming creature, hoping to display enough dominance that the pig capitulates out of sheer awe.

GM: You shake the hog like a hog-shaker from Mudtown on a saturday night. It's weakening, but it still has some fight left in it. What's your next move?

Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist suddenly shifts his grip, attempting to pin the weakened hog against his body by pressing its back into his chest with one arm while holding onto its legs with the other. He leans forward slightly, using his superior strength to hold the hog in place and prevent any further escape attempts. "Not so tough now, are ya?" he says, his breath heavy with amusement at the spectacle.

GM: The hog capitulates, clearly bested and unable to free himself from your grip. As you celebrate your victory, you hear grunting behind you...

Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist pivots slightly on his feet, trying to keep his bulk between the hog and whatever is making noise. "What's this now? Another challenger?" he growls over his shoulder, ready to face the next pig—or whatever it may be—with equal bravado and strength.

GM: As you turn around, you see the most massive boar the world as ever seen, OMEGA-HOG, and it looks pissed as fuck

Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist: "Well, isn't this just perfect?" Blarg's voice is a blend of incredulity and amusement. He flexes his arms with an exaggerated show of strength and smirks at the approaching behemoth of a boar. "Looks like we got us another winner! Omega-Hog, eh? Let me guess—you want to be the alpha hog around here?" Blarg's tone is teasing as he prepares himself for the confrontation, ready to face this latest challenge with equal bravado and confidence in his own superior strength.

GM: OMEGA-HOG rushes towards you, trying to empale you on his massive tusks, how do you react?

Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist attempts a sudden dodge to the side, leveraging his bulk to pivot away from the incoming charge. As he moves, he swings the hog he's still holding like a club towards the charging boar in the hopes of deflecting or entangling Omega-Hog with it. "Oh no, not the face!" Blarg shouts, laughing heartily at his own quick thinking and ready for whatever comes next.

GM: you barely have time to smash the regular hog into OMEGA-HOG before it reaches you. It's your turn to act

Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist swings the still-squirming hog like a flail, hoping to intercept and distract Omega-Hog with its weight and momentum as he barrels toward him. He screams out in laughter, fully embracing the chaotic absurdity of his situation, "You'll have to do better than that, Mr. Big Bad Boar!"

For a time, you and OMEGA-HOG are equally matched, with it flailing is tusks around as fiercely as you are with your improvised hog-club.

GM: But soon, OMEGA-HOG tires of this little game, it rears itself for a furious charge, how do you respond?

Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist drops the hog he's been swinging like a flail and instead charges at Omega-Hog on his own. He lunges forward with outstretched arms, aiming to catch the boar off guard by not matching its ferocious charge with brute force but rather with sheer determination and mass. "Here I come, you big brute!" Blarg roars in challenge, his eyes locked onto the rearing Omega-Hog as he barrels towards it like an unstoppable force of nature.

GM: As unstoppable object meets immovable force, you prove yourself the strongest for a time in this clash of titans. OMEGA-HOG wasn't expecting you to meet him so, and you have the upper hand for now, what do you do?

Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist: Grinning with triumph, Blarg Smashfist grabs hold of one of Omega-Hog's tusks with both hands, digging deep into his calloused palms. He pulls back with all his might, attempting to wrench the tusk from its socket and further establish his dominance over the colossal boar. "You'll be singing a different tune when you're missing some teeth!" Blarg bellows in victory, his voice echoing through the village fairgrounds as he struggles against the powerful creature.

GM: OMEGA-HOG, surprised by the ferocity of your onslaught, loses one of his tusks, as it breaks into your hand. But now, half freed from your grip, it tries to turn around and crush you under his massive girth. How do you react?

Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist spits out a mouthful of blood and broken tooth before laughing heartily at the absurdity of the situation. He tightens his remaining grip on Omega-Hog's remaining tusk, refusing to let go even as it begins to spin around in a desperate attempt to crush him. "Oh no, you don't!" Blarg chortles, bracing himself against the boar's body while pulling back with all of his strength, determined not to be overpowered by this giant of a pig.

GM: you succesfully avoid being crushed under its terribles hooves, it's now your turn to act

Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist grins wildly as he maintains his grip on Omega-Hog’s remaining tusk. He stumbles back a few steps, keeping the boar between himself and any potential threats while thinking quickly. "Alright, you big oinker," Blarg says with mock severity, still laughing, "let's see if you can outdo your own record!" With that, he releases his hold on Omega-Hog’s tusk and takes a running start, charging back at the boar in hopes of knocking it down to size once again. His laughter echoes through the village fairgrounds as he readies himself for another round of chaotic wrangling.

GM: You smash into OMEGA-HOG, toppling it on his side. OMEGA-HOG, local mud bathing expert, tries to turn around with you still on its flank, aiming to crush you between it and the ground below. How do you react?


Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist scrambles for leverage as he finds himself caught between Omega-Hog's immense body and the earth beneath him. With a guttural grunt of determination, he places his hands flat against the boar’s side and pushes with all his might, attempting to roll away from the crushing blow before it can connect. "Not today, you muddy juggernaut!" he shouts in defiance, straining against the weight of the boar as he tries to escape being squashed like a bug.


GM: The weight of the colossus proves too much for you to hold against. You find yourbetween the mud and his fat hairy belly, struggling to move. What do you do?

Blarg Smashfist: Frustrated but unbroken, Blarg shifts his focus from escaping to causing as much chaos as possible while trapped under Omega-Hog's belly. He starts kicking his legs in a wide arc, trying to scatter mud and debris everywhere, hoping it will hinder the boar’s movement enough for him to escape or find an opportunity to turn the tides. "Come on, you slippery swine!" Blarg yells out, each kick accompanied by a hearty laugh as if he's found delight in this bizarre situation amidst the struggle.

GM: There's no use, the beast has you right were it wants you. You have a last opportunity to act, as it stands up, aiming to drop down one last time on you, crushing you for good

Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist: Determined not to meet such a grim fate, Blarg Smashfist focuses all his remaining strength into one final, desperate gambit. As Omega-Hog begins its final descent, Blarg digs his fingers deeper into the mud and earth beneath him, using it as leverage against the immense weight above him. He pushes upward with every ounce of force he can muster, attempting to flip Omega-Hog over onto its back in a last-ditch effort to escape certain squashing. "You'll have to try harder than that!" Blarg roars defiantly, his voice filled with equal parts fury and amusement at the absurdity of his situation.

GM: Despite your taunting, OMEGA-HOG smashes onto you with the full force of his fat fat bod. As you are defeated, the hog takes a little nappy time, with you still under him, crushed in the mud. It was a bit tired from the wrangling you gave him. 3 hours later, the local farmers have the opportunity to free you, all battered and bruised, and they do. Let all now that on this day, OMEGA-HOG proved stronger thant the great Barbarian Blarg. Do you have any closing words?

Blarg Smashfist: Blarg Smashfist: "Well," Blarg says with a strained chuckle while pushing himself up from the mud, brushing off debris and flexing his bruised muscles, "I guess it's true what they say about pride coming before a fall. But hey, at least I went down swinging! And who knows? Maybe next time, Ome-ga-Hog won't be so lazy after our epic bout!" Blarg gives a hearty, if slightly shaky, laugh and offers a salute to the boar with an open palm, "A fine fight, my porcine pal. Until next time!"
