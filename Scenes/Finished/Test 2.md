# Summary :
In an eccentric laboratory run by the enigmatic Lord Guda, a battle unfolded between him and two unlikely heroes: Professor Whizzlebum, an inventor with a penchant for disaster, and Blarg Smashfist, a brawnier companion whose intellect matched his physicality. Amidst a sea of cheese and chaos, they faced down Guda's magical menace, turning the tables with a concoction of science and sheer absurdity, saving Blarg from a fate worse than being turned into a wedge of cheese. Their journey through Guda’s dairy domain culminated in an agreement born out of necessity—a ceasefire until their next potentially disastrous encounter. As they departed, leaving behind a lab in disarray and a lactomancer's pride wounded, the trio promised that this was not the last time science would clash with sorcery in their peculiar world.

# Details :
Today, Blarg, the barbarian and Whizzlebum, the nerd are facing off against Lord Guda, the infamous skeleton lactomancer in a climactic battle.

GM : As you enter the skeletal eyes of the lactomancer bore into yours, boring gruyere cheese holes into your souls.

GM : Who wants to act first?

Group : Blarg Smashfist stomps forward with a thunderous grin, his greataxe held high. "Me! Me wanna hit stuff!" he declares, completely undeterred by the eerie atmosphere or Lord Guda's gaze.

Everyone agrees.

GM : The lactomancer, not intimidated in the slightest, turns to you and says "You have strong bones, fleshling. I'm sure I can find a thousand good uses for them hehehe". It's your turn, Blarg, what do you do?

Blarg Smashfist : Blarg Smashfist grins wider, his eyes gleaming with unfocused enthusiasm as he swings his greataxe in a wide arc, not aimed at any specific target. "Strong bones! Yay! Hit more stuff!" he cheers, completely missing the lactomancer's threat and still focused on the act of destruction he finds most meaningful.

GM : The lactomancer will not tolerate any vandalism in his laboratory. He raises his skeletal finger, wiggles them for a bit, then, molten cheese fondue flies from a nearby cauldron towards Glarg. Entangled in thick ropey cheese, Glarg is stoppped in its tracks before he can break anything.

GM : Whizzlebum, your turn !

Professor Whizzlebum : Whizzlebum : In an attempt to disrupt the lactomancer's concentration and protect Blarg from further retaliation, I quickly rummage through my backpack for a device I hope will short-circuit his magical cauldron. With deft fingers and only slightly trembling, I extract what appears to be a clockwork origami crane with a small compass embedded in its wings, intended to fly towards the curd cauldron and jam its delicate mechanisms. "Hope this helps!" I exclaim, tossing it into the air as the crane flaps wildly before heading toward its target.

GM : It's a pretty stupid idea, you cannot "jam" a caldron, it's just a piece of metal on a fire. Still, as the crane splashes precisely in the center of the cauldron, the Lactomancer gets splashed with boiling dairy. "Ouchie!" He exclaims.


GM : The lactomancer turn to Whizzlebum and says "Oh my, so feeble and brittle, you sir are in dire need of CALCIUM !" A magical hand grabs a bottle of curdled milk from a nearby shelf, while two others grab your forehead and you chin, trying to open your mouth for you to drink the disgusting beverage. How do you react?


Professor Whizzlebum : Professor Whizzlebum : In an attempt to resist the lactomancer's grasp, I struggle against the skeletal hands attempting to force-feed me curdled milk. "No need, no need!" I exclaim, trying to squirm away from their grasp while simultaneously rummaging through my pockets for anything that could help. With a sudden lurch, I manage to extract a small bottle of sparkling water and squirt it into the lactomancer's face, hoping to momentarily distract or disgust him enough to release me. "How about you focus on your own calcium intake?" I snarkily add, trying to sound confident despite my precarious situation.


GM : It works, as you splash the lactomancer, he recoils in disgust. "WATER??? IN MY DOMAIN??? INACCEPTABLE !" He looks furious at the lack of fat and protein in the liquid you splashed him with.


GM : Blarg, the lactomancer has lost control of the fondue cheese that was pinning you in place. It's your turn.


Blarg Smashfist : Blarg Smashfist : Blarg Smashfist, still grinning and full of unwavering enthusiasm, sees an opportunity for more destruction—and maybe a bit of liberation. With a loud battle cry, he charges forward and attempts to dive into the molten cheese fondue with all his might, hoping to create a splash that will knock both him free and potentially douse some of the flames of anger from Lord Guda's bones.


GM : You jump inside the caldron, but it's far too small for a big boy like you. As you land, the cauldron topples, spilling the cheese on the ground. You know find yourself prone in liquid cheese, slowly slipping as the cheese flows from the cauldron. The lactomancer shouts "Not the cheese, you dumb fucking twat!" Some of his power will soon wane as the cheese slowly hardens on the ground, but he's still a terrible foe.


GM : Whizzlebum, it's your turn


Professor Whizzlebum : Professor Whizzlebum : Attempting to capitalize on the chaos and protect myself from further manipulation by the lactomancer, I swiftly scan my surroundings for anything that can provide an advantage. My eyes settle upon a shelf laden with various cheese wheels of different sizes and magical properties, which could potentially be used as projectiles or even as barriers if needed. With quick precision, I grab three such cheese wheels, their hum intensifying in my hands as they recognize the intent behind my actions. "Time for a bit of reverse engineering!" I declare, preparing to hurl them towards any immediate threats or obstacles with the hope of creating more disarray and giving Blarg and myself a chance to regroup and reassess our situation.


GM : You arm yourself with random wheels of cheese. The magic they contain are an anathema to your understanding of mighty science. You can't wrap your hand around what they are supposed to do, but you have them nonetheless.


GM : Blarg, you are laying face down in a puddle of fondue cheese, it's your turn


Blarg Smashfist : Blarg Smashfist : Grinning with undiminished enthusiasm, Blarg attempts to rise from the molten cheese puddle, his face and body splattered with the sticky substance. "Mmm! Tasty!" he exclaims mischievously, unknowingly breaking some of the tension as he uses his immense strength to scoop up handfuls of the now semi-solid cheese around him. With a triumphant battle cry, Blarg prepares to launch this newfound ammunition at any nearby enemies in hopes of slowing them down or causing further disarray within the lactomancer's lair.


GM : The lactomancer laughs, covered in cheese as you are, he's got you right he wanted. As he points his bony finger to you, the cheese you are covered in hardens instantly, preventing you from throwing anything.


GM : Whizzlebum, you have the opportunity to assist Blarg with your random magical cheese whells, if you wish to. You can abstain if you'd like.


Professor Whizzlebum : Professor Whizzlebum : With a determined nod, I grip two of the magically-enhanced cheese wheels firmly in my hands, bracing myself against the inexplicable power coursing through them. "Science may be my domain, but magic can't be ignored!" I exclaim as I prepare to launch these unpredictable projectiles towards any threats that might aid the lactomancer, hoping to hinder his ability to concentrate or retaliate. In a swift and confident motion, I swing my arms forward, releasing both cheese wheels in a curved arc aimed directly at our mutual adversary.


GM : Absent-minded as you are, you have thrown two wheels of Power Cheesus at the lactomancer. One misses, as the other one smashes into his shoulder bone, you see the magical energies enter his body, empowering him.


GM : Seeping with magical energies, the lactomancer turns to you and says "Oh my, thank you NERD! You needed this more than I do, such altruism! Here, please accept this gift of mine in return!" He raises his bony hands and begins an incantation "By pasture and grass, yeast and dairy, your ass shall now turn to Brie!" You only have a few seconds before he finishes it's spell, how do you react?


Professor Whizzlebum : In the face of potential transformation into an animated cheese sculpture, I frantically rummage through my pockets for anything that could counteract this spell. My fingers close around a small vial of liquid nitrogen I had forgotten was in there; it's a scientific accident waiting to happen. "You're not going to turn me into your next cheese course!" I shout back defiantly at the lactomancer, unscrewing the vial and preparing to unleash its icy contents directly into the spellcasting hands that hover ominously over his body.

The ice and cold will disrupt the magical energies coursing through him, shattering whatever mystical bond is forming with my body. "Science versus sorcery! Let's see who wins this battle of elements!"


GM : With quick thinking and the energy of desparation, you quickly throw the liquid nitrogen container directly at his right hand. The container breaks against his strong, hard, well-maintained bones, freezing his hand before he can finish his spell. The magical energies he was manipulating EXPLODE IN HIS FACE.

GM : That was very cool, please, give me your coolest action movie hero one-liner

Professor Whizzlebum : "Science may be my forte, but today, it's cheese that wins the day!"

GM : Blarg, you are now free of any cheese-related impediments, you are free to act. What do you do?

Blarg Smashfist : Blarg Smashfist, now freed from the sticky embrace of the molten cheese and filled with a renewed sense of purpose, charges forward with an unstoppable grin on his face. Still brandishing his massive greataxe named _Thunk_, he darts towards Lord Guda, the infamous skeleton lactomancer, who is momentarily distracted by Professor Whizzlebum's display of scientific prowess.

With a mighty war cry that echoes through the cavernous lair, Blarg attempts to bring down his powerful axe in a decisive blow aimed directly at the center of the lactomancer's skeletal frame. "Time for some bone-crunchin' action!" he bellows, completely undeterred by the magical chaos that surrounds them or the sheer absurdity of his plan to defeat an enemy composed entirely of bones with brute force alone.

Unyielding in his pursuit of destruction—and victory—Blarg plunges headfirst into combat, hoping to shatter the lactomancer's will and dispel the enchantments woven within this dairy domain once and for all.


GM : You bring down your axe in a mighty blow, smashing into the bony frame of the lactomancer. Despite his impeccable calcium-maintained bone structure, you hear a sickening crunch as the hit connects. You think you might have broken one or two ribs.


GM : Lord Guda is indeed a powerfull foe and it will take more than that to take him down ! As you hit him, he begins levitating, stopping all momentum he might have had and regaining balance. As he flies around the room, he begins furiously casting "MILK-BOLT!""MILK-BOLT!""MILK-BOLT!" aiming directly at your mouth. How do you react, Blarg?


Blarg Smashfist : Blarg Smashfist : Reacting quickly to the sudden change in tactics and using his innate ability to deal with threats through brute force, Blarg throws himself to the side, hoping to avoid the incoming magical milk-bolts aimed at his mouth. As he twists mid-air, still clutching his greataxe tightly, he roars out in defiance: "Bring it on! This barbarian doesn't need a straw to drink from the river of battle!" Prepared for the next assault, Blarg's eyes scan the room for any chance to close the distance and take down Lord Guda once and for all.


GM : Bad call Blarg, as you open your mouth to roar a long sentence, Guda immediately uses the opportunity to send one of his milk bolts right into you mouth. The force of the impect swipes you off you feet, you smash your head on the ground and loose consciousness, fresh milk dripping from the side of your mouth.


GM : As Guda focuses his attention on bringin down Blarg, you have the opportunity to act, what do you do?


Professor Whizzlebum : Professor Whizzlebum: Witnessing Blarg's unexpected defeat momentarily distracts me from my own predicament. I quickly reassess my surroundings for any remaining cheese wheels with potential magic. Determined not to let this opportunity slip away and seeing that Guda is temporarily distracted, I grab a small wheel of cheese that seems to hum with residual magical energy left within the room. With precision and urgency, I lob it towards Blarg's unconscious form, hoping to awaken him with a jolt of magical force that might also cause enough disarray in Guda's concentration.

"Science may be precise, but sometimes brute force needs a little nudge!" I shout as I release the wheel, envisioning its impact igniting both Blarg's vigor and our collective resilience against the lactomancer's onslaught.


GM : Sadly you still don't understand which spells the cheeses contain. As the wheel smashes into Blarg's inconscious face, the spell within activates. It was a Fantomatic Wedgie Cheese ! You see a ghostly magic hand grab Blarg by the underwear, lifting him off the ground, crushing his massive balls under his considerable weight. Blarg regains consciousness just long enough to let out a gurgling milk-dripping scream of agony.


GM : The lactomancer, still levitating around the room, sees this and can't resist laughing at this very good milk-themed gag you're performing for him. He tries to stop laughing just long enough to throw a half-assed Milk Bolt attempt at you. How do you react?


Professor Whizzlebum: With the realization that my previous attempt with the cheese wheel did not yield the desired outcome and understanding the lactomancer's continued threat, I quickly scan my environment once more. Noticing a collection of laboratory equipment including test tubes filled with various liquids, I decide to improvise. 

I grab one of these test tubes containing what appears to be an acid-strong solvent known for its ability to disrupt magical energies. With determination in my voice, I proclaim, "Science shall be the key to shatter this arcane tyranny!" As I approach the lactomancer who is momentarily distracted by Blarg's misfortunes, I hold out the test tube, prepared to release its contents towards him.

"Take this, Lord Guda," I say. "May the power of empirical evidence counteract your mystical manipulations!" With a steady hand and unwavering focus on disrupting his spells, I toss the contents of the test tube directly at the lactomancer, hoping it will weaken his hold over both Blarg and myself.

The acidic solution arcs through the air, its potential impact hanging in suspense as we all wait to see if science can indeed prevail over sorcery.


GM : As you take your sweet time analysing the Guda's laboratory, he has the opportunity to teabag Blarg (now laying limp on the floor after the spell ended). He then stops laughing for a bit, slaps your face with a well-aimed Milk Bolt, interrupting your search. As he continues teabagging Blarg, it's your turn to act, what do you do?


Professor Whizzlebum : With a sharp jolt of pain and surprise from the unexpected slap of the Milk Bolt spell, I quickly regain my composure, realizing that time is of the essence. Witnessing Guda's continued mockery towards Blarg's current vulnerable state fuels my determination even more.

I swiftly reach into one of my pockets, rummaging through the contents until I find a small vial containing an experimental concoction designed to counteract magic with an opposing force—essentially a meta-magical antidote. Holding it firmly in hand, I take a few steps forward, positioning myself between Guda and Blarg.

"Enough of this charade!" I exclaim, my voice echoing through the laboratory, commanding attention from all present. "This is as far as you'll go, Lord Guda!"

With unwavering resolve, I prepare to throw the vial towards Guda, knowing that its contents will either disrupt his magic or prove wholly ineffective—a gamble in these uncertain times.

"May the forces of science and reason finally bring balance to this dairy domain!" I shout defiantly, arm extended, ready to unleash the antidote at a moment's notice.

GM : The experimental concoction works ! Who would have thought? The lactomancer's levitating is interrupted mid-teabag, he crashes down onto Blarg's inanimate form. He scrambles to get up, stepping and slipping on Blarg's bulky limbs and appendages.

GM : "Youuu little piece of shit!" he snarls. "I'm going to peel the skin off your bones like those red mini cheese wheels they sell at the store" He's casting again, you don't know what. How do you react? (There's no nitrogen around and you don't have any left on you, keep it short)

Professor Whizzlebum : "Bring it! I've faced worse cheese than you!"

GM : Stupidly, you accept Guda's punishment, hoping to weather it with you weak disposition and scrawny bod. It doesn't go well, as the spell hits you, cottage cheese begins seeping from ALL your orifices. You're dangerously leaking fluids and you suspect your skin will soon begin to peel as Guda threatened if you don't break his concentration. What do you do?

GM : Stupidly, you accept Guda's punishment, hoping to weather it with you weak disposition and scrawny bod. It doesn't go well, as the spell hits you, cottage cheese begins seeping from ALL your orifices. You're dangerously leaking fluids and you suspect your skin will soon begin to peel as Guda threatened if you don't break his concentration. What do you do?

Professor Whizzlebum : I grit my teeth and manage to murmur through the chaos of escaping dairy, "Mighty fine display of sorcery, Guda... but it's gonna take more than that to get a rise out of me." I concentrate on maintaining a steady stream of insults while simultaneously attempting to nonchalantly tinker with some gadget in my pocket. If there's one thing I've learned from my countless mishaps, it's how to keep myself distracted when things go... curdulently wrong.

GM : You're taking too long to react, the outer layers of your skin are already turning into melting cheese. Do something, quick dude !

Professor Whizzlebum : *Desperate* "Ha! My body's just a veritable dairy farm now, huh? Well then, Guda, feast on this!" I yank out an electronic device from my pocket with my gooey hands and toss it at the cauldron — it's a remote-controlled clockwork cheese slicer. If I can get it to slice through one of those enchanted milk vats, maybe we can redirect some of this sorcerous cheddar towards your skeleton frame! *Grabs the last clean piece of clothing on me and wipes face*

GM : The cheese slicer activates, thumbling wildly inside the cauldron. Soon, the whole cauldron begins wobbling, splashing cheese around. The lactomancer, seeing this, laments "Fuck, fuck, fuck, stop wasting my fucking cheese, you fucking moron! Do you know how much time it takes to make it so perfectly?" The spell is interrupted for now.

GM : You are both exhausted, Guda has had enough with the cheese-spillage, you're still dripping with cheese that once was your epidermus and it hurts quite a bit. Guda looks a you and says "Look, you're a pain in the ass, let's call it quit. You stop spilling my cheese and leave me be, and I'll give you your friend back, you can both leave this place alive." What do you respond?

Professor Whizzlebum : "Ha! A truce, did you say? Well, Guda, how about we shake on that agreement? But first, let's address the matter of my dear friend Blarg. I believe he’s currently undergoing a rather… ripe experience in your cauldron. If you’re so keen on seeing us depart this place alive, perhaps you could consider *not* having attempted to turn him into an involuntary cheeseball?" I say with a smirk, wiping more melted cheese from my eyes while trying to appear as nonchalant as possible, given the situation.

GM : "Just take your friend and fuck off" he says, already turning his attention to cleaning the total mess that once was his laboratory.

Professor Whizzlebum : *Mustering all the bravado I can muster through my dairy-soaked state* "Well, Guda, it seems our little... agreement is on hold until we've settled this tiny, uh, 'misunderstanding'. You see, I'm afraid your laboratory wouldn't be quite the same without us—particularly since you seem rather keen on *not* continuing to turn it into a dairy nightmare. So why don't we just... shall we say, adjourn this meeting for now? Perhaps when you've finished your, ahem, 'clean-up', we can reconvene with more... amicable terms?" I suggest, trying to sound as non-threateningly reasonable as someone dripping in cheese can.

GM : "NO! YOU FUCK OFF ! And if I ever see you again, i'm going to put so much gruyere holes in your ass you'll never know which one to wipe!"

Professor Whizzlebum : Professor Whizzlebum : "Oh, absolutely, Lord Guda. Your wish is our command; we'll be sure to... fuck off," I say with a forced chuckle while still dripping cheese everywhere. "And rest assured, if we ever cross paths again, I'd expect nothing less than your signature gruyere treatment! It's been quite the... educational experience here in your lab." I manage to bow slightly despite my melted state before turning towards Blarg and attempting to help him up with a cheese-coated limb.


GM : Blarg, you're in rough shape, but still alive, do you have anything to say before you both fuck off into the sunset?

GM : Blarg, you're in rough shape, but still alive, do you have anything to say before you both fuck off into the sunset?

Blarg Smashfist : Blarg : "Guda, you think your cheese tricks scare me? I've got a rock for a brain, remember? It doesn't scare me. But this...gruyere grudge of yours—it's just a hole-y idea! Ha, get it? Hole-y? Anyway, let's go before he chases us with more dairy disasters!" *Giggles while still dripping cheese, trying to pick up the massive greataxe lying nearby*

GM : You both leave, leaving the lactomancer who will have a shitty time repairing the chaos you wrought in his lair.
