# Description

Today, our intrepid group of 4 is doing a classic dungeon crawl, they've done their business as usual, kill the mobs, kill the boss, get the loot. But, after the Boss Room, where they would expect to find a nicely game-designed loop to the entrance of the dungeon for easy exit, they instead find themselves in front of a door blocking the way.
It's a massive granite door, with a massive granite head sculpted into it. With its flat, massive granite voice, it bellows "PLEASE RECOCUMBULATE."
But you don't know what recocumbulate even means...

GM : The massive granite doors asks you to recocumbulate, none of know know what this means. Designate among youselves the one who will act or say something first

Dicepaw Critclaw: *rolls tiny dice* Well, obviously it's a typo. The door meant 'recapitulate.' I'll clarify that for them. *struts forward, looking at the door imperiously*

Goblinette: Oh my goodness, no! It clearly says recocumbulate and that means we must recline or sit down before proceeding! How ever could you be so rude as to ignore a command from such an impressive door? *bats eyelashes dramatically*

Professor Whizzlebum: Ah yes, the erudite among us will note the Latin root 'cumba' meaning to recline. Thus, recocumbulate is indeed akin to recapitulate but referring specifically to physical rest! *proudly taps goggles* I suggest we take a short respite, my friends.

Blarg Smashfist: *scratches head, looking at the door confused* Uhh... what it say? Recocumbu... lap? Like sit on laps? But why? Is this a new type of puzzle? *thumps chest with fist* I ready to smash if that's what needed!

Dicepaw Critclaw: *scoffs* It's not a lap, you oaf. Pay attention! We're to recline or take a seat before the door opens. Clearly it's some sort of ritual or test. *turns back to the group* Everyone sit down on the floor right here in front of the door. That should satisfy it.

Goblinette: Oh dear, I do hope that will suffice! One wouldn't want to anger such a grand and powerful portal. *flicks skirt and sits elegantly, crossing legs*

Professor Whizzlebum: Indeed, best not to provoke it further. Perhaps a moment's rest before proceeding is warranted in any case. *settles cross-legged with a sigh, adjusting his lab coat*

Blarg Smashfist: *hesitates, then plops down heavily, nearly knocking Goblinette over* There! Me sit now! Door open yet?

GM : You all sit before the massive door, taking the opportunity to rest. It's refreshing but after a few minutes, the door still hasn't moved.
