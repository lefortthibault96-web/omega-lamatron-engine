After their retreat from the fiasco at Lord Guda's Lair, Blarg and Whizzlebum are camping in the woods, liking their wounds. The sun is setting, the woods are perfectly peaceful. A perfect opportunity to rest.



GM : quick blarg smash something !


GM : quick Smash something !


Blarg Smashfist : Blarg Smashfist looks around at the peaceful campsite and grins, his eyes shining with excitement. "Oooh! Shiny! SMASH!" He pounces on a nearby rock, raising his massive greataxe _Thunk_ in preparation for a mighty swing. "One... two... THREEEEEEEE!" BLARG brings _Thunk_ down with all his might, the axe biting deep into the rock and sending sparks flying. "Hahahaha! SMASH WORKS!"


GM : what do you do?


Goblinette : *squeals in delight* "Ooh, Blargy, that was SO dramatic and exciting! I can just imagine the crowd gasping at the mighty SMASH!" She claps gleefully, frilly cape fluttering. "Perhaps you could smash something even shinier next time? Like a treasure chest or a dragon's skull?" Her eyes sparkle with mischief as she twirls around, tiara tilting precariously on her head.


GM : try to do a backflip


Professor Whizzlebum : "Oooh, a backflip sounds thrilling!" He exclaims with enthusiasm, his voice rising an octave as excitement takes over. "Here goes nothing!" With that, Whizzlebum turns around and leaps backwards, arms outstretched in an attempt at a grandiose flip. Unfortunately for him, he forgets to account for the campfire in his trajectory. WHIZZLEBUM face-plants into the flames with a startled yelp, soot and sparks flying everywhere as he struggles to extract himself from the inferno. "Oof... perhaps I should work on my acrobatics," he remarks sheepishly once freed, brushing off singed robes.


GM : Blarg, a goblin arrives, telling you "I fucked you mom last night, teehee", what do you do?


Blarg Smashfist : Blarg Smashfist's face turns bright red and his eyes bulge in outrage at the goblin's crude statement. "WHAAA?! MOMMY NO LIKE THAT! SMASH YOU!" He brandishes _Thunk_ menacingly, baring teeth in a furious snarl as he charges at the impudent little creature, roaring with a rage that shakes the trees.


GM : The goblin is no match for you, do with it as you please in vivid detail


Blarg Smashfist : Blarg Smashfist swings his mighty greataxe _Thunk_ down towards the goblin's head, aiming to cleave its skull in two with a single powerful blow. "SMASH YOU SOFT GOLLUM!" he roars, putting all his strength behind the strike. The axe bites deep into the goblin's face, crushing bone and splattering brains as it sheers through to the other side of its head, nearly decapitating it in one fell swoop. Blarg then stomps on the twitching corpse, grinding it into the dirt beneath his heavy boot with a satisfied "Hah! Gollum can't talk nasty now!"
