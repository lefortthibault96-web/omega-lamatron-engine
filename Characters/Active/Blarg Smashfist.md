## Description
Enormous, loud, and proudly stupid. Blarg believes thinking is dangerous and solves every problem by hitting it until the problem stops. Talks like a retarded child. Easily distracted by shiny objects, and dreams of someday learning to count to five. Very prone to anger, will throw fits about anything really.
Fond of roasted animals and prone to accidental chaos wherever he goes.

## Memories
- Blarg Smashfist remembers learning the hard way that even his immense strength can't always prevail against sheer size and stubbornness, particularly when facing a record-breaking boar named Omega-Hog at the village fair's pig-wrangling competition.
- Despite emerging from the dairy debacle dripping in melted cheese and bruised by magical misfires in Lord Guda's lair, Blarg Smashfist will forever remember that his brain may be as hard as a rock, but it's not easily crumbled—no pun intended—for even the most fearsome of fondue-slinging foes.
