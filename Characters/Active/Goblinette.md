## Description
A runaway goblin princess who fled her underground throne to avoid an arranged marriage to a troll “with NO sense of accessorizing.” Flamboyantly girly, obsessed with sparkles, pink frills, and dramatic entrances. Demands to be treated like royalty at all times and claps excitedly at everything. Very snobby. Cannot resist correcting everyone’s posture or giving unsolicited etiquette advice. Despite her constant fussing, she’s surprisingly competent in goblin politics, poisons, etiquette, and professional screeching.
