# Description
A sleek, clever cat with an unusual talent: professional tabletop roleplayer. Speaks perfectly fluently and has an encyclopedic knowledge of dice, rulesets, and meta-strategies. Spends most of his time critiquing character builds, optimizing party tactics, and gently mocking allies for suboptimal rolls. Loves snacks, particularly those awarded as game prizes, and has a habit of knocking dice off tables when frustrated with poor play. Surprisingly charming, insufferably smug, and utterly committed to “winning at storytelling.”
